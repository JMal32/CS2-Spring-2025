# Neutrino oscillation where v_e were changing into v_r and t_r

# Weak nuclear force beta- : n  p + e^- + V_e 
Beta + : p  n + e^+ + v_e

Quanta of the weak force is weak boson written as W^+ or W^-
W boson is what borrows energy – uncharged quanta of weak force is z boson
1961 Sheldon Glashow predicted Z boson. Electroweak theory was in 67 with Abdus Salam Steven Weinberg. ’79 Nobel Prize in physics for work on electroweak unification

Higgs field is used to explain why the W and Z bosons have large masses. Higgs boson interacts with W and Z bosons – reducing speeds to below the speed of light, c. Detected in 2012 and was about 125 GeV/c^2

Strong force should also involve exchanged quanta of energy. ‘30s Hideki Yukawa predicted particle for strong force was called meson. In 1947 pion was discovered. Can have positive, negative and neutral charge. Pions are exchanged, but they are not the exchanged quanta of strong force. Particles K Alpha and E (Greek E)


# Strangeness. Conservation of strangeness is conserved by strong interaction but NOT by weak interactions

## Murray Gell-Mann realiEd newly discovered particles followed a logical mathematic patter based on a "group". It suggested these particles 

# Quantum Chromodynamics
  ## 6 different "flavors" of quarks: up, down, strang, charm, top, and bottom.
    Hadrons = 3 quarks
    Mesons is quark and antiquark

  ## Quarks have a property called "color charge" (nothing to do with colors by light)
     Red, green, or blue. When they combine, they become white (colorless)
      antiquark colors are anti-red, anti-green, anti-blue. Combined, they become white
    Real particles must always be colorless.
    color force -- color confinement and asymptotic freedom
    Gluons are the particles responsible for transmitting the color force. They can interact with quarks and other gluons
    
# Feynman Diagrams - look at slides

# Grand unified theory (GUT) would incorporate QCD and electroweak theory into a single combined interaction
  ## Smaller distances - 3 forces act more as a single underlying force, but greater distances break symmetry
    predictions for decay of a proton - but would take about 10^34 years
    magnetic monopoles have yet to be discovered

# Strings and Supersymmetry
  ## Theory of everything 
    one candidate is string theory. supersymmetry is basically dead after no discoveries when higgs boson was discovered

# Exam Discussion Options:
  ## A. Have exam 3 on Tuesday with no review
  ## B. Combine exam 3 and final


# Physics 2 Exam review
  ## Exam 4 question review
    Question 5 - If we double the single slit diffraction hole, it cuts spread out by half
    Question 6 - frequency stays the same, wavelength decreases when moving from one medium to another
    Question 7 - 1.56 degrees. double slit angle question
    Question 8 - If it is 1 slit per cm, then 7000 would be 1/7000. But we need to convert that to meters so it would be 1/(7000)*100
    Question 9 - Interfrence is the reason for colors on thin film. Different thicknesses will be diff colors due to wavelength
    Question 10 - Brewster's Law determine angle which an incoming beam of light becomes completely polarized after reflection
    Question 11 - What lenses to choose to maximize magnification of refracting telescope. 
    Question 12 - Lens power question. P = 1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i = 1/0.25m - 1/0.23 <- +3.6 D for prescription. Remember you get + values for farsighted
    Question 13 - Remember to add + 1 for *maximum* angular magnification
    Question 14 - (1.22(550*10^-9m)/.003m) then you have to multiply by 1 rad which is 52.79 degrees
    Question 15 - Move away from sensor
    Question 16 - Possion's Spot was shadow in middle slot

  ## Final Exam Review
    Baseball field cools off faster than concrete parking lot
    Water has better specific heat than silver - so it would cool to between 0c and 50c
    v = kQ/r charges will be V = 0 across all points on x axis
    When 2 capacitors are connected in parallel to a battery, *the voltage drop across each capacitor is the same*
    Need at least 2 rays to make a ray diagram.

# Exam 2 Review (more final exam review stuff)
  ## Two particles with charges of 4C and -4C separated by 4m. What is the electric potential energy of the two
      36mJ
  ## Which statement is valid
    If the potential diff thruout a particular region is constant, the field throughout 
    that region must be zero
  ## Proton and electron in constant electric made my oppositely charged plates. Release both 
    Both charges gain the same kinetic energy - will their velocities be the same?
## In a region of uniform electic field, the electric potential is measured to be +400V at x = 2m and -2000V at x = 8 What is the magnitude of the e-field in this region?
    400 V/m
## Two wires, A and B, are made of the same material, have the same length, and are held at the same temp. THe radius of wire B is twice that of A. If resistance of A is R, what is resistance of B?
    r = el/a = el/pi*r^2     for R_a el/pi*r_a^2  Answer is R/4
## If we double size of resistance in a circuit while keeping current constant, power dissipated by that circuit will...
    be two times as great. P = IV = I^2R = V^2/R
## If voltage applied to "ohmic" resistor doubles, resistance of the resistor...
    will stay the same - resistance is going to be the constant. current is what changes in response to voltage. input affects output
    example = if you double the voltage across the plates, the capacitance stays the same. the Q and V are what change, not C
## 400W device turned on for 8h a day. If electricity costs .10 per kWh, how much does it cost to run the computer for 365 days?
    400W = 0.4kW (0.4kW)(8h) = 3.2kWh so we take (3.2kWh/day)(365 days)(0.1)
## 500W device is ocnnected to 120VAC power source. What is the peak current across this device?
    Peak Power = 500W = I_rms * V_rms  => I_rm = PeakPower/V_rms = 500W/120V then we get sqrt
## Kirchoff's junction rule is a consequence of conservation of...
    charge => the loop rule *this will be on the final*    remember that current is jsut moving charge. so if current is conserved then charge is ocnserved
## 3ohm resistor in parallel with 6ohm resistor. This combo is then connected in series with a 4.0ohm resistor and ideal 12-v batttery. How much power is dissipated by the 3ohm resistor?
    5.3W => ohm's law says voltage drop is proportional to resistance.
